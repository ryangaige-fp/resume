                    <p>As a graduate of Boise State University with a major in IT Management, I have a strong passion for technology
                        and enjoy working in a field that is constantly evolving and requires continuous learning. I thrive
                        in high-pressure and fast paced environments. I utilize business management principles to independently
                        plan and direct all levels of professional affairs. I am an energetic and hard-working individual
                        who possesses effective verbal and written communication skills. My work ethic, experience, and willingness
                        to adapt and continually learn will enable me to contribute to any organizations success.</p>
